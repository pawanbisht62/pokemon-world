## Setting up your environment

### Rustup.rs

Building this project requires [rustup](https://rustup.rs/), version 1.8.0 or more recent.
If you have an older version, run `rustup self update`.

To install on Windows, download and run [`rustup-init.exe`](https://win.rustup.rs/)
then follow the onscreen instructions.

To install on other systems, run:

```
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

This will also download the current stable version of Rust, which this project wonâ€™t use.
To skip that step, run instead:

```
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- --default-toolchain none
```

## Running Application

```
git clone https://github.com/pawanbisht62/pokemon-world.git
cd pokemon-world
cargo run
```

### Testing
This repository contains unit and integration test cases of all the available functionality. To execute the test cases hit this command:
```
cargo test
```

* Note:
All the test case won't be able to executed successfully as the translated endpoint of pokeapi accepts only 5 requests in an hour.
